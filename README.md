Canine Cupid is the dog-matching app you and your pup have been waiting for. Just make an account outlining your dogâ€™s likes, dislikes, and personality traits to match them with a friend that is just as special as they are. Collaborating with a team of three we set out to create a Dog friendly dating app to match with local singles (or set up a playdate with their furry companions). The back end of this application was built using MongoDb, Mongoose, bcrypt, Heroku, MLAB, MVC, Travis CI, and NPM . Later I completely stripped this version and redesigned it for Canine Cupid V2, check it out!
